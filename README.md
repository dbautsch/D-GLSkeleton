# D-GLSkeleton
A very basic, but usefull GLSkeleton app written in D language using OOP paradigmate.
You will have to install DUB in order to compile this application (see https://code.dlang.org/download).

It is tested on Linux (Mint 18) and run properly. May require some additional packages (glfw3-dev for sure!).

This program has not been tested yet on Microsoft Windows platform. Try it by yourself!
